On Australia Day weekend 2021, I had a climbing accident that put me in a wheelchair for a couple of months.

The hardest part was going from being a fully autonomous, independent human to exceedingly reliant on nurses and my partner Kaja. My reliance on other kind people manifested in many ways. 

The first day I was home from the hospital, I was so sore from surgery I couldn't move in the bed. Then, out of nowhere, a bee flew into the bedroom. Powerless to stop this invader or shoo it out, I yelled to Kaja, "Help me! there is a bee in the room!" to which she ran into the room thinking there was an actual emergency. Luckily she saved the bee and me by banishing the bee from the room.

Throughout the experience, people commented on how optimistic I was. I think this has to do with my expectation for making a full recovery. Without that, I think it would have been much more challenging.

I did feel like everyone was looking at me, which was okay; I just stared back at them.

The Politically Correct culture makes for great material as people are afraid to offend you:

At the Polling Place, I was told, "Please stand on the square over there" I replied, " I won't be standing, thanks."
Waiting outside the disabled toilet and staring at the able-bodied person coming out of the toilet.
