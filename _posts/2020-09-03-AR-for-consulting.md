AR is a key facet of the 4th industrial revolution along with 3D printing, AI, digital twins and cloud computing. As stated by KPMG Digital Delta Partner Piers Hogarth-Scott, [It is critical that business leaders understand these technologies and how to harness them to remain locally and globally competitive](https://home.kpmg/au/en/home/insights/2020/02/2020-fourth-industrial-revolution-benchmark.html).

This article explores some of the practical use cases for AR to deliver value at a low cost.

## Traditional AR

When AR is mentioned, an image such as below probably comes to mind. These purpose build headsets are powerful and deliver an immersive experience.

### 1. Design 

Reviewing sctructures can be much quicker and more intuative using VR rarther than using Navisworks or similar. No specilist viewing software is required and the models are easily shared. Models can be placed on the table in a meeting room for everyone to see, scale and move around. Differennt models can be overlapped to easily display the differences between versions.

<model-viewer width="100%"
    src="/models/props.glb"
    ios-src="/models/props.usdz"
    style="width: 80%; height: 300px; display: flex; justify-content: center;"
    ar autoplay camera-controls background-color="#2CCC">
</model-viewer>

### 2. Operations

As the models can be animated, entire operations can be modelled and animated by accuratly constraining the model. The animation could also be connected to simulation data to show realistic  motions such as a ship's responses in waves. 

<model-viewer width="100%"
    src="/models/spoolLift.glb"
    ios-src="/models/spoolLift.usdz"
    style="width: 80%; height: 300px; display: flex; justify-content: center;"
    ar autoplay camera-controls background-color="#2CCC">
</model-viewer>

### 3. Interactive Deliverables

Using Reality Composer software by Apple, AR can be made fully interactive while also simulating gravity and object interactions. This could be used to make interactive deliverables to display results of a calculation. 

### 4. Surveys

Using either photogrammetry or a laser scanning device, a model could be quickly built then viewed in VR in the office to help identify any anomalies or damage. The model below was created from 12 photographs and processed in [RealityCapture](https://www.capturingreality.com). The great accuracy of the mesh comes at a cost as the file size is large, originally 100Mb. This is at the limit for what phones can currently display in AR thus only the newest 2019 and 2020 phones will be able to display models this large.

<model-viewer width="100%"
    src="/models/spoolLift.glb"
    ios-src="/models/spoolLift.usdz"
    style="width: 80%; height: 300px; display: flex; justify-content: center;"
    ar autoplay camera-controls background-color="#2CCC">
</model-viewer>

### 5. Education
With the current travel limitations due to covid and budget constraints, it may be difficult for graduates to get valuable on-site experience. An alternative to this could be a creating an AR portal 
### 6. Hot Desking 

Using object detection, the global coordinates in the VR space can be locked to a fixed object in space. This allows tags or infomation to be connected to desks. The tags can be connected to a database and allow for dynamic updating of the office layout.

### 7. Orentation 

Some office layout can be very complex and maps can be confusing. VR could provide easy directions to any meeting rooms, toilets or the kitchen.
