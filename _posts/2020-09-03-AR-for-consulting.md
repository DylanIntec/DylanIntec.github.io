AR is a key facet of the 4th industrial revolution along with 3D printing, AI, digital twins and cloud computing. As stated by KPMG Digital Delta Partner Piers Hogarth-Scott, [It is critical that business leaders understand these technologies and how to harness them to remain locally and globally competitive](https://home.kpmg/au/en/home/insights/2020/02/2020-fourth-industrial-revolution-benchmark.html).

This article explores some of the practical use cases for AR to deliver value at a low cost.

## Traditional AR

When AR is mentioned, an image such as below probably comes to mind.

### 1. Design 

Reviewing sctructures can be much quicker and more intuative using VR rarther than using Navisworks or similar. No specilist viewing software is required and the models are easily shared.

### 2. Operations

As the models can be animated, entire operations can be modelled and animated. The animation could be connected to simulation data to get realistic vessel responses in waves.

### 3. Hot Desking 

Using object detection, the global coordinates in the VR space can be locked to a fixed object in space. This allows tags or infomation to be connected to desks. The tags can be connected to a database and allow for dynamic updating of the office layout.

### 4. Orentation 

Some office layout can be very complex and maps can be confusing. VR could provide easy directions to any meeting rooms, toilets or the kitchen.

### 5. Surveys

Using either photogrammetry or a laser scanning device, a model could be quickly built then viewed in VR in the office to help identify any anomalies or damage.
